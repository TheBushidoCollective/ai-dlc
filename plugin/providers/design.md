- Reference design files in unit Technical Specification sections
- When generating wireframes (Phase 6.25), reference component names from the design system in HTML comments but maintain low-fidelity aesthetic

## During Building
- Reference design specs for UI implementation
- Verify component usage matches design system

## During Review
- Cross-reference UI implementation against design specs
