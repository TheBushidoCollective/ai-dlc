We're excited to introduce **AI-DLC**, a methodology for structured, iterative software development with AI assistants.

## The Challenge

Working with AI assistants like Claude has transformed how we write software. But with this power comes new challenges:

- How do we maintain focus when context can shift at any moment?
- How do we ensure quality when development speed increases dramatically?
- How do we measure progress when traditional metrics no longer apply?

We built AI-DLC to address these challenges.

## The Solution

AI-DLC introduces two core concepts: **hats** and **units**.

### Hats

Hats represent distinct mindsets and responsibilities:

- **Researcher**: Understand the problem before acting
- **Planner**: Design the approach with clear steps
- **Builder**: Execute the plan with focus
- **Reviewer**: Validate quality and completeness

By explicitly switching between hats, you prevent context drift and ensure each phase gets proper attention.

### Units

Units are focused pieces of work with clear success criteria. Breaking work into units ensures:

- Progress is measurable
- Scope is controlled
- Quality is verifiable
- Momentum is maintained

## Getting Started

AI-DLC is distributed as a Claude Code plugin. Install it with:

```
/install-plugin thebushidocollective/ai-dlc
```

Then start using the hat commands to structure your workflow.

## Part of Han

AI-DLC is part of the [Han plugin ecosystem](https://han.guru) for Claude Code. Han provides a curated marketplace of plugins built on Bushido principles: quality, honor, and mastery.

We believe AI-assisted development deserves the same rigor and discipline as traditional software engineering - just with new tools and methods.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're actively developing:

- More documentation and guides
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Team collaboration features
- Metrics and analytics
