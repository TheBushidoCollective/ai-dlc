## Results

### Score: 20-24 - Strong Fit

**AI-DLC is likely a great fit for your team.**

Your team is well-positioned to adopt AI-DLC. You have:
- Existing AI tool usage providing foundation
- Team openness to new methodologies
- Work that suits structured approaches
- Organizational support for adoption

**Recommended approach:**
1. Start immediately with Phase 1 (Individual Developer)
2. Plan for full team adoption
3. Expect quick wins and smooth adoption

### Score: 14-19 - Good Fit with Preparation

**AI-DLC could work well with some preparation.**

You have good foundations but some gaps to address. Look at which sections scored lowest:

**If Team Readiness is low:**
- Start with education about AI-DLC benefits
- Address concerns before formal adoption
- Consider starting with most receptive team members

**If Work Suitability is low:**
- Focus on work types that fit best initially
- Develop skills in writing verifiable criteria
- Build decomposition habits gradually

**If Organizational Support is low:**
- Build a business case with expected benefits
- Start small to demonstrate value
- Seek management alignment before team rollout

**Recommended approach:**
1. Address lowest-scoring area first
2. Start with a limited pilot
3. Demonstrate value before expanding

### Score: 8-13 - Conditional Fit

**AI-DLC may help, but significant preparation needed.**

There are notable gaps that need addressing. Consider:

**Prerequisites before adoption:**
- Build AI coding assistant usage habits
- Develop documentation practices
- Create space for learning and experimentation
- Secure management support

**Alternative considerations:**
- Lighter-weight AI practices might be better starting point
- Focus on team fundamentals first
- Revisit AI-DLC in 6-12 months

**If you proceed anyway:**
1. Start with one enthusiastic individual
2. Keep scope very limited
3. Be prepared for slower adoption
4. Don't mandate team-wide adoption yet

### Score: 0-7 - Not Yet Ready

**AI-DLC is likely not the right approach right now.**

Your situation has too many obstacles for AI-DLC to succeed. This isn't a judgment - it's about fit.

**Focus instead on:**
1. Building basic AI assistant familiarity
2. Developing quality-focused practices
3. Creating organizational space for process improvement
4. Addressing time pressure issues

**Revisit when:**
- Team has AI coding assistant experience
- There's management support for process investment
- Work pressure allows for methodology learning

## Special Considerations

### For Startups

**Score < 14?** That's okay for early-stage startups. Focus on:
- Building product-market fit first
- Using AI assistants informally
- Establishing basic quality practices
- Adopting AI-DLC when you have product direction

### For Enterprise

**Score > 18?** Consider broader implications:
- Governance requirements
- Multiple team coordination
- Training at scale
- Tooling standardization

### For Regulated Industries

Add these questions:
- Can AI-DLC artifacts support compliance? (Probably yes)
- Do you need special workflows for regulated work? (Consider adversarial)
- How do you audit AI-assisted development? (AI-DLC helps with this)
