# Designer Guide

This guide covers how designers can work effectively within the AI-DLC methodology. Whether you're creating design specs, reviewing implementations, or collaborating with AI-assisted development, AI-DLC provides structure that benefits the entire team.

## Your Role in AI-DLC

Design work intersects with AI-DLC at several key points:

1. **Intent Definition** - Helping define what success looks like visually
2. **Completion Criteria** - Specifying measurable design requirements
3. **Review Phase** - Validating implementations match design intent
4. **Iteration** - Providing feedback that guides refinements

## Writing Design Completion Criteria

The most impactful thing you can do is write clear, verifiable design criteria. Vague specs lead to back-and-forth; precise specs let AI build correctly the first time.

### From Vague to Verifiable

| Vague | Verifiable |
|-------|------------|
| "Looks good on mobile" | "At 375px width: navigation collapses to hamburger, cards stack vertically, text remains readable (16px minimum)" |
| "Clean design" | "Component follows 8px grid, uses only colors from design tokens, maintains 4.5:1 contrast ratio" |
| "Consistent with brand" | "Uses Inter font family, primary buttons use --color-brand-500, icons from Lucide set" |
| "Accessible" | "All interactive elements keyboard accessible, focus states visible, ARIA labels on icons" |

### Structure Your Criteria

Organize design criteria by category:

```markdown
## Design Completion Criteria

### Layout
- [ ] Container max-width 1200px, centered with 24px padding
- [ ] 3-column grid on desktop (>1024px), 2-column on tablet (768-1023px), 1-column on mobile (<768px)
- [ ] Cards maintain 16px gap between items

### Typography
- [ ] Headings: Inter Bold, sizes per type scale (h1: 48px, h2: 36px, h3: 24px)
- [ ] Body: Inter Regular 16px/1.5 line-height
- [ ] Captions: Inter Regular 14px, --color-gray-600

### Colors & Contrast
- [ ] All text meets WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for normal, 3:1 for large)
- [ ] Interactive states: hover, active, focus, disabled defined
- [ ] Dark mode variants specified

### Components
- [ ] Buttons follow design system (primary, secondary, ghost variants)
- [ ] Form inputs 44px min height, visible focus rings
- [ ] Loading states for async operations
```

### Include Visual References

Reference your design files directly:

```markdown
## Visual Reference

**Figma:** https://figma.com/file/...

### Key Screens
- Home: Frame "Home - Desktop" (design token: page-home)
- Mobile nav: Frame "Nav - Mobile Open" (design token: nav-mobile)
- Empty state: Component "Empty State/No Results"
```

## The Designer's Hat Workflow

### During Research Phase

When the team is in Research, you can contribute:

- **Competitive analysis** - How do others solve this UX challenge?
- **Pattern research** - What standard patterns apply?
- **Accessibility research** - What WCAG requirements apply?
- **Design system audit** - What existing components can we reuse?

### During Planning Phase

When the team is Planning, help define:

- **Component breakdown** - Which design system components needed?
- **Responsive strategy** - How does layout adapt?
- **Animation spec** - What motion/transitions required?
- **Edge cases** - Empty states, error states, loading states

### During Building Phase

While Builders work, prepare:

- **Design QA checklist** - What you'll verify in review
- **Responsive screenshots** - Expected appearance at breakpoints
- **Interaction flows** - Expected hover/click/focus behaviors
- **Asset exports** - Icons, images, any custom graphics needed

### During Review Phase

This is where you shine. Review against:

1. **Visual fidelity** - Does it match the design?
2. **Responsiveness** - Does it work at all breakpoints?
3. **Interactions** - Do states and animations feel right?
4. **Accessibility** - Can you navigate with keyboard? Is contrast sufficient?
5. **Edge cases** - How do empty states, errors, and loading look?

## Writing Design Feedback

When review finds issues, write actionable feedback:

### Bad Feedback

> "The spacing looks off"

### Good Feedback

> "The gap between the hero section and the feature cards is 48px, should be 64px per the design system section-spacing token"

### Structured Feedback Template

```markdown
### Issue: [Brief description]

**Expected:** [What the design specifies]
**Actual:** [What was implemented]
**Reference:** [Link to Figma frame or design system doc]
**Fix:** [Specific change needed]
```

## Design System Integration

AI-DLC works best with a design system. If your team doesn't have one, consider creating:

### Design Tokens File

Create a tokens file Claude can reference:

```markdown
## Design Tokens

### Colors
- --color-brand-500: #2563eb (Primary CTA)
- --color-gray-900: #111827 (Headings)
- --color-gray-600: #4b5563 (Body text)
- --color-gray-100: #f3f4f6 (Backgrounds)

### Spacing
- --space-xs: 4px
- --space-sm: 8px
- --space-md: 16px
- --space-lg: 24px
- --space-xl: 32px
- --space-2xl: 48px
- --space-section: 64px

### Typography
- --font-heading: Inter, sans-serif
- --font-body: Inter, sans-serif
- --font-mono: JetBrains Mono, monospace
```

### Component Specifications

Document your components:

```markdown
## Button Component

### Variants
- **Primary:** bg-brand-500, text-white, hover:bg-brand-600
- **Secondary:** bg-transparent, border-gray-300, text-gray-700
- **Ghost:** bg-transparent, text-brand-500, hover:bg-brand-50

### Sizes
- **sm:** h-32px, px-12px, text-14px
- **md:** h-40px, px-16px, text-16px
- **lg:** h-48px, px-24px, text-18px

### States
- **Hover:** darken 10%
- **Active:** darken 15%
- **Focus:** 2px ring, ring-offset-2, ring-brand-500
- **Disabled:** opacity-50, cursor-not-allowed
```

## Working with AI-Generated UI

Claude can generate UI code, but it needs clear guidance. Help by:

### Providing Context

Include in your design specs:

- Tailwind class mappings for your tokens
- Component library being used (Radix, shadcn, etc.)
- Animation library (Framer Motion, CSS transitions)
- Icon set (Lucide, Heroicons, etc.)

### Setting Constraints

Be explicit about what NOT to do:

```markdown
## Design Constraints

### Do Not
- Use colors outside the design system palette
- Add animations not in the motion spec
- Create new component variants without approval
- Use font sizes outside the type scale
- Use spacing values not in the spacing scale
```

## Review Checklists

### Feedback
- [ ] Buttons show click feedback
- [ ] Form errors clearly indicated
- [ ] Loading states for async actions
- [ ] Success/error confirmations
```

## Collaboration Tips

### Async Collaboration

Since Claude works in sessions, document decisions:

- Keep a `design-decisions.md` file in `.ai-dlc/`
- Screenshot Figma comments into the repository
- Use PR reviews for design feedback

### Synchronous Collaboration

When working live with a developer using Claude:

- Watch the implementation happen
- Call out misalignments early
- Provide immediate feedback on judgment calls

### Handoff Best Practices

For smooth handoffs:

1. **Organized Figma** - Name frames clearly, use components
2. **Written specs** - Don't rely on Figma alone
3. **Responsive notes** - Document breakpoint behavior
4. **Asset exports** - Provide optimized images/icons
5. **Motion specs** - Document animations in writing
