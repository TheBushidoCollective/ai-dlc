# Introduction to AI-DLC 2026

AI-DLC 2026 is a methodology for structured, iterative software development with AI assistants. It provides a framework for organizing work into focused units with clear phases and responsibilities.

## Why AI-DLC?

When working with AI assistants like Claude, it's easy to fall into unfocused patterns:

- Context switches happen mid-task
- Requirements drift without clear boundaries
- Quality suffers from lack of structured review
- Progress is hard to measure

AI-DLC addresses these challenges by introducing structure without adding unnecessary overhead.

## Core Principles

### 1. Intentional Context Switching

Instead of letting context drift organically, AI-DLC uses "hats" to mark explicit transitions between different modes of work. When you switch hats, both you and your AI assistant understand that the focus and expectations have changed.

### 2. Focused Units of Work

Work is organized into units - focused pieces of functionality with clear success criteria. Each unit is small enough to complete in one session but meaningful enough to deliver value.

### 3. Quality Built-In

Review is not an afterthought. Every unit goes through all four phases, ensuring that research, planning, building, and review all get proper attention.

### 4. Measurable Progress

Because work is organized into units with clear criteria, progress is always measurable. You know exactly where you are and what remains.

## Getting Started

1. Install the AI-DLC plugin in your Claude Code project
2. Define your first unit of work with clear success criteria
3. Move through the four hats: Researcher → Planner → Builder → Reviewer
4. Complete the unit and move to the next

See the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start/) guide for detailed instructions.
