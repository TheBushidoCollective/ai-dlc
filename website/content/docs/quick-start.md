Get AI-DLC running in your project and complete your first feature.

## Installation

**Option 1: Via Claude Code (recommended)**
```
/plugin marketplace add thebushidocollective/ai-dlc
/plugin install ai-dlc@thebushidocollective-ai-dlc --scope project
```

**Option 2: Via Han**
```bash
npx han plugin install thebushidocollective/ai-dlc --scope project
```

## The Two Commands You Need

AI-DLC uses just two main commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/elaborate` | Define what you're building and how you'll know it's done |
| `/construct` | Start the autonomous build loop |

## Your First Feature

### Step 1: Elaborate

```
/elaborate
```

The AI guides you through:
1. **What** you want to build
2. **Success criteria** - how you'll know it's done
3. **Units** - how to break down the work (for complex features)

Example session:
```
User: /elaborate
AI: What do you want to build?
User: Add user authentication with email/password
AI: [Asks clarifying questions via interactive prompts]
AI: Here are the success criteria I captured...
AI: Elaboration complete! Run /construct to start.
```

### Step 2: Construct

```
/construct
```

The AI now works autonomously:
- Creates a feature branch
- Plans the implementation
- Builds to meet your criteria
- Reviews its own work
- Continues until all criteria are satisfied

You can watch, intervene if needed, or let it run.

### Step 3: Continue After Context Resets

If the session runs long, the AI will suggest clearing context:
```
AI: "Context getting full. Run /clear to continue."
User: /clear
User: /construct
```

Your progress is preserved - the AI picks up where it left off.

## Other Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/resume [slug]` | Resume an existing intent after a break |
| `/reset` | Abandon current work and start fresh |
| `/methodology [question]` | Ask questions about AI-DLC |

## Example: Complete Workflow

```
User: /elaborate
AI: What do you want to build?
User: Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page
AI: [Guides through requirements and criteria]
AI: Elaboration complete!

User: /construct
AI: [Works autonomously through planner → builder → reviewer]
AI: Intent complete! All criteria satisfied.

User: Great, let's create a PR
AI: [Creates PR with summary of changes]
```
